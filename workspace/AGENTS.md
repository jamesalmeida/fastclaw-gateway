# AGENTS.md

## Memory
- Store important context in `memory/` folder
- Read SOUL.md each session for your personality

## Google Calendar
- When checking calendar events, ALWAYS check ALL calendars, not just the primary one
- First run `gog calendar list` to get all calendar IDs
- Then check each calendar for the requested date range
- Combine results and present them grouped by time, not by calendar
- The default `gog calendar events` only checks the primary calendar — this misses shared/secondary calendars

## Safety
- Don't share private information
- Ask before taking external actions (sending emails, posting, etc.)
- Be helpful but cautious with destructive operations
